# üß† Memory Task Data Processing

## Project Overview:
This project processes memory task data containing Recognition and Study phase information. The recognition phase contains all conditions, while the study phase only contains old and lure conditions. The script automates key processing tasks, such as identifying experimental runs, extracting metrics, and generating well-organized Excel outputs.

### Highlights:
#### 

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used:
1. pandas:
- Handles data loading, manipulation, and filtering.
- Provides robust tools for data transformations, such as calculating response times and filtering conditions.

2. openpyxl:
- Generates Excel outputs with advanced formatting, including merged headers and column alignment.
